# ChatGPT Spring Boot Web Application with Stomp and Websocket

This web application demonstrates the implementation of an OpenAI API messaging tool using Stomp and Websocket. Its 
foundation is derived from the Spring guide titled "Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application".

To build this web application, you will require JDK 17 and Gradle. Additionally, to make OpenAI API calls, you will need 
to place an OpenAI API key into the application property file. To start the web application, run the following command 
from the codebase's root directory:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
After which, the user can proceed to their preferred web browser and navigate to the URL:
```
localhost:8080
```
Here, they will be able to commence a conversation with ChatGPT.
